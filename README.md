Felt like trying out JavaFX and MVC for graphical interfaces

It's probably terrible :D

It should play just like normal minesweeper, with the additional rule, that if you have all mines flagged, you win
(this should help avoid scenarios where you have a bunch of 50/50s and have to guess, instead you can try all possible
variants)

P.S. Too lazy to add options, sorry :P
